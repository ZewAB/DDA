# DDLASSO

Double-debiased LASSO (DDLASSO) for high-dimensional estimation of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT).

---

This repository provides code to estimate the ATT using DDLASSO. It includes three separate scripts:

- DDLASSO for the first simulation setting  
- DDLASSO for the second simulation setting  
- DDLASSO for the IHDP dataset

**IHDP dataset source:** [CEVAE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/CEVAE/tree/master/datasets/IHDP)
