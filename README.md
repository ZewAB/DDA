# DDA
Debiased and data-adaptive (DDA) estimation of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in high
dimensions


---

This repository provides code to estimate the ATT using DDA. It includes three separate scripts:

- DDA for the first simulation setting  
- DDA for the second simulation setting  
- DDA for the IHDP dataset
- DDA for many cluster settings

**IHDP dataset source:** [CEVAE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/CEVAE/tree/master/datasets/IHDP)
